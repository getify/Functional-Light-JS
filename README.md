# Functional-Light JavaScript (book)

This book explores the core principles of functional programming (FP) as they are applied to JavaScript. But what makes this book different is that we approach these principles without drowning in all the heavy terminology. We look at a subset of FP foundational concepts that I call "Functional-Light Programming" (FLP) and apply it to JavaScript.

**Note:** Despite the word "Light" in the title, I do not consider or recommend this book as a "beginner", "easy", or "intro" book on the topic. This book is rigorous and full of gritty detail; it expects a solid foundation of JS knowledge before diving in. "Light" means limited in scope; instead of being more broad, this book goes much deeper into each topic than you typically find in other FP-JavaScript books.

Let's face it: unless you're already a member of the FP cool kids club (I'm not!), a statement like, "a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors", just doesn't mean anything useful to us.

That's not to say the terms are meaning*less* or that FPrs are bad for using them. Once you graduate from Functional-Light, you'll maybe/hopefully want to study FP more formally, and you'll certainly have plenty of exposure to what they mean and why.

But I want you to be able to apply some of the fundamentals of FP to your JavaScript *now*, because I believe it will help you write better, more *reason*able code.

## Publishing

I'm self-publishing this book, most likely digitally [on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/fljs/). I'll also be trying to work out an option to sell print book copies, but that part is still uncertain.

If you'd like to contribute financially towards the effort (or any of my other OSS work) aside from purchasing the books, I do have a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/getify) that I would always appreciate your generosity towards.

## In-person Training

The content for this book derives heavily from a training workshop I teach professionally (in both public and private-corporate workshop format) of the same name.

If you like this content and would like to contact me regarding conducting training on this, or other various JS/HTML5/Node.js topics, please reach out to me through any of these channels listed here:

## Online Video Training

I also have several JS training courses available in on-demand video format. I teach courses through [Frontend Masters](https://FrontendMasters.com), like my [Functional-Lite JS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-js-lite/) workshop. Some of those courses are also available on [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/search?q=kyle%20simpson&categories=all).
